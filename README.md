# Project Description 🎨💡
The inspiration behind Phantom Pages, our invisible ink note-taking website, stems from the playful spirit of the ‘Useless Projects’ event. This project reimagines the traditional concept of note-taking by introducing invisible ink—a quirky and fun twist that defies practicality while embracing creativity. By making notes invisible, Phantom Pages invites users to rethink the boundaries of functionality in an amusing and unexpected way.

This project humorously challenges the norms, offering an interface that hides the notes you take—celebrating a design that is both unconventional and engaging. It’s a delightful approach to blending creativity with technology, encouraging users to explore the fun side of productivity tools.
